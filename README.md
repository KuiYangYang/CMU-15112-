# CMU-15112-
This is my term project in CMU Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, which is a technical introduction to Pyhon programming language. My project, builder, is a design interface for architecture. First, users should design a 2D plan, they should create a room and set up the scale. And then the room will generate in the board, user also can move, rotate and delete the room. Second, users can put objects(desk , chair, door, etc) inside the room, and the objects can also be moved, rotated and deleted. In the end, the 2D design drawing can transfer to isometric view, users can navigate their design in the 2.5D space.


How to run the project:
The project has four files including 'main','roomAndObject','isometric' and 'cmu_112_graphics'.
The 'main' file is the main file in my project which calls for other files.
The file includes most UI and UX functions, user must run the file to start my project.
The 'roomAndObject' file sets up the property of objects such as length, width, and center.
The 'isometric' file mainly converts 2D coordinates to 2.5D. The file also sets up heights for every object.
In my project, I do not use any module and library but 'cmu_112_graphics'.
