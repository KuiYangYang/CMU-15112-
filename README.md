# CMU-15112-
Project's name: Builder
Builder is a design interface for architecture. 
Users can create a room and configure the position for furniture, windows and doors. 
The user experience allows all objects except the room to be moved, rotated and deleted. 
When completing 2D design, users can transfer to isometric view and navigate the space by rotating the view.

How to run the project:
The project has four files including 'main','roomAndObject','isometric' and 'cmu_112_graphics'.
The 'main' file is the main file in my project which calls for other files.
The file includes most UI and UX functions, user must run the file to start my project.
The 'roomAndObject' file sets up the property of objects such as length, width, and center.
The 'isometric' file mainly converts 2D coordinates to 2.5D. The file also sets up heights for every object.
In my project, I do not use any module and library but 'cmu_112_graphics'.
